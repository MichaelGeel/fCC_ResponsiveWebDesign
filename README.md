# fCC_ResponsiveWebDesign
This repository contains all the work I've done and code I've written as I followed the course material for the Responsive Web Design course and certification hosted by freeCodeCamp.

## Acknowledgements and Ownership

All project code in folders under "Lessons" is not my original work as it was a guided creation provided by freeCodeCamp and I personally consider it all their work as such.
However, the projects and relevant code that are under the "CertificateProjects" folder are all my own unique creations and I take ownership of that code. 
I do credit freeCodeCamp for the provision of the project outlines and a high level guidance on the outcomes and requirements of these projects but ultimately they are my own unique work.
